# TempScale
This repository contains R code associated with the submitted manuscript "Estimating the temporal scale of lagged responses in species abundance and occurrence" (Sollmann, R., Ecosphere). The script 'Likelihood and other functions.R' contains the novel likelihood functions used to fit the four versions of the temporal scale model described in the manuscript. The 'Simulation script.R' runs the main simulation scenarios presented in the manuscript; it does not, in itself, contain novel code. Neither does the 'Simulation summary.R' script, which can be used to summarize simulations with respect to bias and precision of model estimates and recreate the two main figures.
